## 📈 Dashboards & Insights

### 1. Content Acquisition Strategy: From Licensed to Original

**Question:** How did Netflix transition from licensing existing content to producing originals?

**Key Findings:**
- In 2010, Netflix was adding content that was 23 years old on average - primarily licensing back-catalog films
- By 2013-2014, the acquisition lag dropped dramatically to under 1 year for TV shows, indicating a shift to original series
- Movies maintained a 6-7 year lag through 2018-2020, suggesting Netflix continued licensing recent films while focusing original production on TV

**Insight:** Netflix's "originals-first" strategy became evident around 2014-2016, particularly for TV content, transforming them from a distribution platform to a content creator.

*Explosive growth: India emerges as a major hub (large circle), Turkey and Pakistan enter the mix, South Korea and Japan circles grow substantially. Netflix's "global original content" strategy becomes reality - dozens of countries now producing content.*

*Mature global platform: Content contributions from 50+ countries, with India, UK, South Korea, and Japan as major hubs alongside the US. The map shows Netflix achieved its goal of being a local content producer in nearly every market.*

This two-year window saw them enter dozens of markets simultaneously and begin commissioning local original content - fundamentally changing their competitive position against traditional media companies.

### 4. Ratings Distribution: Targeting Mature Audiences

**Question:** What audience demographics does Netflix prioritize?

**Key Findings:**
- TV-MA (mature audiences) consistently represents 35-55% of all content additions
- TV-14 content is the second priority at 20-40%
- Family-friendly content (TV-PG) declined from 38% (2011) to just 8% (2019)
- Combined, TV-MA and TV-14 content represents ~70% of Netflix's catalog by 2020

**Insight:** Netflix clearly targets adult audiences, with mature content dominating their production strategy. This likely reflects both viewing patterns and competition with family-oriented platforms like Disney+.
